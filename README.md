Gator Blog Aggregator

Gator Blog Aggregator is a command-line tool designed to scrape and aggregate RSS feed data from multiple blogs. It allows users to manage feeds, create accounts, and fetch posts from different blogs, storing them in a database for future retrieval. The tool supports login and registration functionality, user-specific feed management, and feed scraping at configurable intervals.
